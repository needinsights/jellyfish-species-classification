## Project Information
This project is part of Hacktiv8's Challenge.

## Objective
This programme was created to perform classification on the different jellyfish types:
- Barrel jellyfish
- Compass jellyfish
- Mauve Stinger jellyfish
- Blue jellyfish
- Lions Mane jellyfish
- Moon jellyfish

From the dataset obtained in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/jellyfish-types). The classification is done with a model primarily focusing on the usage of CNN model architecture. The data is first checked for consistency in terms of image size and colour channels before moving on to augmenting the images to generate more training images. Multiple models were created to find the best fit model.

# NOTE: This programme was primarily written in `Google Colab`, expect some functions to return an error upon running all.
